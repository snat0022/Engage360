=======================================
âš¡ ACTION REQUIRED: Verify Sender Email
=======================================

Your SendGrid API key is configured and deployed!
But you need to verify the sender email address.

Steps:
1. Go to: https://app.sendgrid.com/
2. Click: Settings â†’ Sender Authentication
3. Click: Verify a Single Sender
4. Enter: noreply@engage360.com
5. Fill in the form (Name: Engage360, etc.)
6. Check your email and click the verification link

Without this, SendGrid will reject emails!

Current Status:
âœ… API Key: Configured
âœ… Application: Deployed
âš ï¸  Sender Email: NOT VERIFIED (Required)
